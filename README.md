# Applied Machine Learning Assignments

This is a collection of Applied Machine Learning Assignments I wrote for a class at McGill. The assignments were supposed to be submitted in a jupyter notebook format.

### Assignment 1

The first assignment consisted of several parts. The first part involved writing a sampling algorithm that sampled from a multinomial distribution (more information in the notebook). Then, there are several questions that deal with (1) fitting a polynomial regression model to data analytically and exploring L2 regularization and (2) fitting a linear regression model to data using stochastic gradient descent. The final part of the assignment involved missing-attribute completion and linear regression using the Communities and Crime Data Set from the [UCI repository](https://www.google.com).

### Assignment 2

This assignment explored classification using a Gaussian Discriminant Analysis model, and comparing this model to a k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) model. Datasets were generated synthetically by (1) sampling from a multivariate Gaussian distribution (unique to each class) and (2) sampling from a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distrbutions (more information can be found in the notebook).

### Assignment 3

In the final assignment, I designed a sentiment classifier for classifying Yelp (ratings /5) and IMDB reviews (thumbs up/thumbs down). Using sci-kit learn, I implemented and compared a naive Bayes model, a decision tree model, and a linear SVM using both binary bag of words (BBoW) and frequency bag of words (FBoW) representations of the datasets.
